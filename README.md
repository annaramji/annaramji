### What am I up to?
- ⚡️ I'm currently a Data Analyst at [Gridware](https://gridware.io/)
    - The majority of my work is in Databricks... and due to config settings, only my merged PRs count as contributions on my contribution plot 🥲
- 🌊 I recently worked on updating the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) calculations as part of the OHI Fellowship at @[NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)
- 🌱 I graduated from the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management's [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) program in June 2024.
    - This program culminated in a Capstone Project: Identifying Priority Survey Sites for Early-Season Milkweed Conservation

    - As the Data Manager on this project, I created a [Dryad Archive](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2rbnzs7x4) (DOI 10.5061) of our data products and in-depth data documentation.

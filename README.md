The majority of my work is in Jupyter Notebooks, R Projects, and Quarto Projects using R, R Markdown, Quarto Markdown, and Python. GitHub seems to consider .Rmd and .Qmd files as HTML. I also use CSS, SCSS, HTML, and JavaScript for website development and improving the appearance of markdown files rendered to HTML. I have experience in SQL using duckdb, sqlite3, and am learning how to use PostgreSQL.
